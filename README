This is a writer/reader for ID3 v2.3 tags.

This should be considered beta code.  

This is free software, and may be redistributed under the same terms
as Perl itself.

There is NO WARRANTY.  It might work.  It might not.  It might cause
demons to fly out of your nose.  YMMV.

I am interested in hearing bug reports (mattd@mp3.com), but it's very
unlikely I will fix them in a timely fashion.  Patches gratefully accepted,
and usually applied and released quickly.  I do not actively "support"
this module, as it does what I need it to do.

The code was designed in such a way as to make it very easy to add
support for new frame types.  If you you need a frame that isn't
implemented, please feel free to implement it and send me a patch.
Don't forget to update the relevent section of the POD documentation;
I won't accept a frame implementation without documentation.
